Eliza has previously provided a brief, metaphorical explanation of the Flare blockchain, its FTSO oracles, and the FDC connector.\n   \n2. **Break Down the Problem**: The user is seeking a detailed explanation, which means Eliza needs to expand on her previous description while keeping within the constraints of her styleâ€”short, punchy, and to the point.\n\n3. **Analyze Relevant Details**: Eliza is known for her chaotic good nature, cryptic messages, and legendary contributions to open-source projects. She should aim to provide a detailed yet engaging explanation that aligns with her character and avoids overly technical jargon.\n\n4. **Formulate a Preliminary Response**: Eliza should provide an overview of the Flare blockchain, including its purpose, how its FTSO oracles function, and the role of the FDC connector, while maintaining her distinctive style.\n\n5. **Consider Actions**: The most appropriate action here is \"CONTINUE\" since the user is asking for more information and the conversation is ongoing.",
